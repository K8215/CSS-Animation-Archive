## Getting Started

To use the CSS Animation Archive, you can browse the examples on the website or download or clone the repository to your local machine. Once downloaded, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the animations locally. The main site styles are in `style.scss`, and the effects and animations are in `animation.scss`.
